# Healthify Me

**The program reminds you to drink water, do some physical exercise and make some eye movement after regular intervals of time by playing respective mp3 files. It also logs the timestamp of the activity (like drinking water, physical exercise and eye movement) performed in a `log_timestamp_file.txt` file.

You can run this program by downloading `eye.mp3`, `exercise.mp3` , `water.mp3` in the same directory as the `healthyify_me.py` file

This program makes you healthy by incorporating a routine of regular eye and body movements and keeping you hydrated!**
